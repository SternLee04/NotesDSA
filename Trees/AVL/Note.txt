Interview perspective AVL is not so IMP.
Concept and understand is required for Rare case.
In Interview question and theory may ask but not Implementation AVL in term of code.

Theory :

AVL == Selfbalancing BST (internal Implementation is make it possible).

Insert, remove and serach == O(H)
AVL can be skewed too : ex. { 1, 2, 3, 4} 

Balance factor : Height of left subtree - Height of right subtree == -1, 0 , 1 ;
= |HL - HR| < 2

make AVL tree :

1. bfactor is violated
2. case
3. rotation

examples :

state order 30 20 10
make bst :
        30
    20
10
figurout where bfactor is volated (30, 2)
where the new node is added its 10 in left subtree.
so case is LL case -> Right rotate.
give right rotate :
         20
    10        30

same when RR case -> left rotate.
