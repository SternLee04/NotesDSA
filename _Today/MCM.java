 * MCM
 * matrix chain multiplication
 * 
 * Math :
 * matrix if A and B matrix multiplication only possible
 * when Am = Bn for An x Bm and Bn x Bm
 * A = 2 * 3 , B = 3 * 6 then C is possible 3 == 3
 * 
 * after multiplication new matrix C will be
 * Cn = An and Cm = Bm. C = 2 * 6
 * 
 * total number of times multiplication.
 * N( A * B ) = An * Bm * (Am | Bn) 
 * N( C ) = 2 * 6 * 3 = 36
 * 
 * problem :
 * there is only a array given to us.
 * arrays represent
